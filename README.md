# Flappy Bird
- This project implements the game Flappy Bird in C, using the gfx graphics library (created by a professor at Notre Dame).
- flappybird.c is the main driver file for the program and contains the primary loop that runs the game.
- flappyfunc.c contains all the functions necessary for making the game's logic work properly. 
- flappyfunc.h is the header file that contains the necessary declarations
  and macros.
- To play, the GCC compiler and the Xming display server are required. If these requirements are met, then simply clone this repository and type "make" into the           terminal. Then type "./flappybird" for the game to pop up as a GUI. Press the spacebar to fly the bird and press q to quit.
